<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Highlighted Projects:</h2>

- **[Super Market Profit Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperMarketProfitDashboard/SuperstoreProfitDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**
  - **Data**: Tableau sample data
  - **Audience**: Sales executives
  - **Purpose**: Identify factors behind low profit ratio in order to boost profits
  - In this dashboard, I used a Tableau dataset containing sample sales data from 2018 to 2021. Though the sample dataset provides a wider overview of sales data, I saw an opportunity to strategically visualize clear, actionable insights to my fictional audience of sales executives. The dashboard allows my audience to immediately pinpoint the geographical, categorical, and seasonal factors that are leading to profit loss ‚Äî providing the guided insight that allows them to impact change on their team.

- **[World Happiness Rankings Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldHappinessDashboard_16964334147960/WorldHappinessReport?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**
  - **Data**: World Happiness Report
  - **Audience**: Anyone interested in geography & culture
  - **Purpose**: Explore and interact with visualized world happiness data
  - The World Happiness Report dataset ranks the happiness of 155 countries from 2015 to 2019. For this dashboard, I wanted the audience to be able to dive deeper into countries around the world and gain a contextual understanding of where those countries rank against the world average. The dashboard allows the user to explore the world map and compare metrics across countries. I'm endlessly interested in world geography and cultural nuances, so I created a dashboard that gets right to the information points I would most want to play with.
